The Power Platform is a suite of low-code tools that allow users to build custom business solutions with ease. With its drag-and-drop interface and visual development tools, the Power Platform enables users to create applications, automate workflows, and analyze data without the need for extensive coding experience.

However, as with any software development project, it is important to ensure that changes made to the Power Platform are tested thoroughly and deployed in a reliable and consistent manner. That's where Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) come in.

CI/CD is a software engineering practice that involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes. By implementing CI/CD, developers can ensure that changes to the Power Platform are thoroughly tested and deployed quickly and consistently, reducing the risk of errors or bugs in production.

Using tools like Github or Azure Devops, we can start to implement these concepts and allow for an environment where we can begin to track the lifecycle of applications, ensure code quality is maintained, and standardise a build, test, and deploy process amongst many potential developers of a Solution.

In my previos blogs, I've talked about Service connections and Solution versioning. Expanding on these concepts we can aim to create a robust CI/CD process using pipelines to first export our solution to a new branch, create a pull request to merge our solution into the main branch, trigger build validation prior to merge, review code changes, and then build a managed solution ready for deployment. This forms a great basis for ALM for our Power Platorm solutions, and also supports parralel development for multiple developers.

## The Setup

There's a number of things to set-up
